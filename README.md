## Spurious Introduction
As an aspiring developer and cyber security professional, it is important to be able to communicate and demonstrate your abilities to prospective employers.

This task requires you to demonstrate that you can build a complete application from design through to deployment for a specified use case.

## Brief
You are to design a full stack web application (app) to meet a user need. You must determine a user need and how this application will meet that need. You will then produce the required documentation to demonstrate this planning.
